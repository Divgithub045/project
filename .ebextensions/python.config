    # WSGIPath specifies the location of your WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) application.
    # The format 'module_name:callable_name' explicitly tells Gunicorn to:
    # 1. Import the 'application' module (which corresponds to 'application.py').
    # 2. Find the callable object named 'application' within that module.
    # This addresses the 'ImportError: Failed to find application, did you mean 'application:application'?'

  # This section sets environment variables for your application.
  aws:elasticbeanstalk:application:environment:
    # PYTHONPATH tells Python where to look for modules.
    # Adding '/var/app/current' ensures that Python can find modules
    # in the root of your deployed application bundle.
    PYTHONPATH: /var/app/current:$PYTHONPATH

# You can add more configurations here if needed, for example:
#   aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:platform:
#     # If you want to specify a Python version explicitly (e.g., Python 3.8)
#     PythonVersion: 3.8

#   aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:proxy:
#     # If you're using a specific proxy server configuration (e.g., nginx)
#     ProxyServer: nginx

#   aws:elasticbeanstalk:cloudwatch:logs:
#     # To enable logging to CloudWatch
#     StreamLogs: true
