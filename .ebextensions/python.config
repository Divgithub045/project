    # WSGIPath specifies the location of your WSGI (Web Server Gateway Interface) application.
    # It tells Gunicorn to look for a callable named 'application' (by default)
    # inside the 'application.py' file.
    # Since your 'application.py' is in the root of your project and your Flask app
    # instance is named 'application', this is the correct path.

    # Adding '/var/app/current' ensures that Python can find modules
    # in the root of your deployed application bundle.
    PYTHONPATH: /var/app/current:$PYTHONPATH

# You can add more configurations here if needed, for example:
#   aws:elasticbeanstalk:container:python:platform:
#     # If you want to specify a Python version explicitly (e.g., Python 3.8)
#     PythonVersion: 3.8

#   aws:elasticbeanstalk:environment:proxy:
#     # If you're using a specific proxy server configuration (e.g., nginx)
#     ProxyServer: nginx

#   aws:elasticbeanstalk:cloudwatch:logs:
#     # To enable logging to CloudWatch
#     StreamLogs: true
